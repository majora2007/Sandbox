Thanks for trying out ProBuilder!

This "Free Version" allows anyone to quickly test out the basic geometry building and editing features of ProBuilder. The core philosophy is to be fast, intuitive, and even fun to use- whether you decide to purchase or not, feel free to share your thoughts and feedback. Even better, post on the probuilder forum:

"www.sixbysevenstudio.com/forum"

Like what you see? Unleash your full creativity with the full version of ProBuilder! Paint a different texture on each face, control UV scale, offset, rotation and more, enable auto-collision, build zones, triggers, occlusion, NoDraw, and so much more.

If you find the free version useful, please consider purchasing ProBuilder, either via the Asset Store or directly at:

"www.sixbysevenstudio.com/probuilder"

Lastly, I always appreciate any "social shares" (facebook, twitter, etc), if you like ProBuilder- help spread the word, and support the on-going development of this and more tools!

Thanks everyone,
