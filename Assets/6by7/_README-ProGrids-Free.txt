Thanks for trying out ProGrids!

This "Free Version" lets anyone try out the core functionality of ProGrids- grid snapping and visual grids -and decide for themselves how useful it is. Personally, I can't imagine working on a game without full, proper, grids and snapping.

While this version is free to use however you like, if you find it useful, please consider purchasing the full version to support ongoing development of this and other tools. 

The full version also gives you access to even more functionality:
-grid size control
-grid unit control (meters, cm, inches, feet)
-"Snap to Grid" button, which snaps all selected objects to the nearest grid point for each
-Toggle the visible grid on/off
-Use the Angle Guides
-Change the grid colors and opacity


You can purchase ProGrids either via the Asset store, or directly at:

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, whether you own a copy or not, please don't hesitate to post on the forum at:

Lastly, I always appreciate any "social shares" (facebook, twitter, etc), if you like ProGrids- help spread the word!

Sincerely,
